# **Overview**:
A simple mod for making the stamina infinite.

# **Conceptualization**:
While playing the game. I got frustrated that my stamina ran out and I only cleared a small part of the farm. It's so cluttered, filled with trees and weeds and I wanna clean it so bad. So with this, I entered the modding scene of Stardew Valley for the first time in 10 years. I modded a game again. 10 years ago, while I was in 6th grade I wrote a Kamehameha Cleo Mod for GTA Vice City, I uploaded it but my dumbass probably forgot to title it properly. So it's now gone forever.

# **Progress**:
v1.1.0
We now use Harmony to patch it as an event.

v1.0.0
We check the stamina changes every frame and set it to max value.
