1. Always Max Quality - A person reached out to me saying that I should add a toggle on the max quality. So they can turn it on, buy something then turn it off again and go on about their day. And also keep in mind the integration of Item Bags and shit. For some reason also, rabbit's foot and wool doesn't get affected by this mod
2. Bountiful Foraging - One of the commentors said I should check out this mod Wildflour's Atelier Goods to see if my foraging mod will work with other mods.
3. Helpful Pets - For now, it's fine. 1.4.0 is a massive update afterall.
4. Fix Museum Inventory - this one is still unconfirmed but I know someone will definitely write a bug encounter. This one is about recreating the Museum Inventory from scratch after all.
