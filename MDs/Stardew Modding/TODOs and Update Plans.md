1. Always Max Quality - A person reached out to me saying that I should add a toggle on the max quality. So they can turn it on, buy something then turn it off again and go on about their day. And also keep in mind the integration of Item Bags and shit. For some reason also, rabbit's foot and wool doesn't get affected by this mod
2. Bountiful Foraging - According to one comment it makes some vanilla spawnables completely disappear from the game because of the so called priority system. Great example for this is the sea urchins and coral missing from the beach which I personally noticed. Also the digging spots! They if not almost disappeared from the game because of this mod. Not only that! The custom spawnables of other mods. We need to take this on account as well. They probably work but they just probably became so rare or completely not spawning because of being outnumbered.
3. Helpful Pets - Alright 1.4.0 changelogs for other details. But for now these are what i wanted fix. the foraging mechanics while following should be tone down like the cat will not forage far very far foragables and instead will keep close to the player and only forage close items so that the following wouldn't die as a mechanic. Next the pouch items. They really need to get emptied. But i still need to think of the best logic here. After finding nothing work to do, return to idle state. multipet follow system should work perfectly but as i see it, animals combine because they have the same speed and shit. While "exploring" we could also make the cut do stuff like cut trees and so on. like cut weeds, stones and boulders! This'll make us help clear the stardew valley but make sure that it is not by default in the gmcm. Bruhhh i realiezd that exploration also includes interiors goddamnit, need to fix that as well! Also the fact that it doesnt return to idle (and to farm) after realizign that there's no foragables on those areas anymore are concerning. Next! The pets should return to idle state the next day! And another bug. I just realized that the pets literally share the same inventory so it needs fixing on that as well! To lessen the dialogue option even more, if a cat was already petted, why not remove the option to pet it? the next time dialogue is opened? Also we can call the cat anywhere when it's exploring but why not when idle and working as well. That would be a good addition.
4. Fix Museum Inventory - this one is still unconfirmed but I know someone will definitely write a bug encounter. This one is about recreating the Museum Inventory from scratch after all.
