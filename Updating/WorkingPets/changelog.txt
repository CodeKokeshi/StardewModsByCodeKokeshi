1.4.1
=== Stability & Crash Fixes ===
- FIXED: Crash when whistling an exploring pet! Warping now uses DelayedAction for safe async operation.
- FIXED: Added null checks and try-catch around all warp operations to prevent crashes.
- FIXED: StopExploring now safely handles edge cases (events, festivals, null locations).

=== Inventory Full Handling ===
- NEW: Pet automatically stops foraging/exploring when inventory is full!
- NEW: Inventory full check runs before any pickup attempt - no wasted effort.
- NEW: When inventory fills up during explore, pet returns to Farm and goes idle.
- NEW: Pets won't chase forageables if they have no space to store them.
- NEW: **ALWAYS** shows HUD notification when inventory is full (regardless of notification settings).

=== Auto-Explore Feature ===
- NEW: Pets will autonomously decide to explore ONCE per day when idle for too long!
- NEW: After ~30 seconds of idle time, there's a chance the pet will start exploring on its own.
- NEW: Auto-explore only happens once per day - resets at start of new day.
- NEW: Requires inventory space - won't auto-explore if inventory is full.

=== Notification Improvements ===
- NEW: "Show Forage Notifications" config option - disabled by default!
- NEW: "Show State Notifications" config option - disabled by default!
- CHANGED: Forage pickup HUD messages now respect ShowForageNotifications config.
- CHANGED: State change messages (follow/explore/work start/stop) respect ShowStateNotifications config.
- IMPROVED: Less spam by default - only shows notifications when you enable them.

=== Whistle Menu Improvements ===
- CHANGED: "Exploring" status now shows location! e.g. "Exploring (Mountain)", "Exploring (Forest)"
- CHANGED: Removed gold color from status - now uses normal text color for consistency.
- IMPROVED: CurrentExploreLocation property tracks which area the pet is currently exploring.

=== Debug Log Reduction ===
- REMOVED: Verbose state change logs (started/stopped working/following/exploring).
- REMOVED: Movement debug logs (wall-pass activation, arrival at target, scanning for work).
- REMOVED: Forage pickup/inventory logs that cluttered the console.
- IMPROVED: Debug logs now reserved for edge cases and errors only - cleaner console output!

1.4.0
=== NEW: Autonomous Explore Mode ===
- NEW: "Go explore the valley!" - Pet autonomously forages across Stardew Valley without following you!
- NEW: Pet scans entire area for forageables, collects them all, then teleports to the next area.
- NEW: Explores only standard Stardew Valley areas - NO Ginger Island, NO Desert!
- NEW: Valid explore areas include: Farm, Town, Mountain, Forest, Beach, BusStop, Backwoods, Railroad, Woods, and more.
- NEW: "Come back home" option returns pet to your location instantly.
- NEW: Separate from Follow mode - choose between following you OR exploring independently.
- NEW: Uses same BLINK wall-pass system to reach forageables through obstacles.
- NEW: Whistle menu shows "Exploring" status in gold color.
- NEW: Whistling an exploring pet will stop exploration and make them follow you!

=== MAJOR: Complete Follow System Rewrite ===
- FIXED: Pet stuttering and left-right flickering completely eliminated! Movement is now buttery smooth.
- FIXED: Pets no longer get stuck on ANY obstacles - EXTREME BLINK mode kicks in automatically.
- FIXED: Vanilla pet behavior no longer interferes with mod-controlled movement.
- FIXED: Pets won't randomly fall asleep or sit down while following you.
- FIXED: "Moonwalking" bug (moving while facing opposite direction) after picking up forageables.
- FIXED: Pets can now cross beaches, rivers, and any terrain without getting stuck!
- FIXED: Pets now IMMEDIATELY look for the next forageable after pickup instead of returning to player!

=== EXTREME BLINK Wall-Pass System (Stuck Recovery) ===
- NEW: When stuck for ~0.5 seconds, pets activate EXTREME BLINK MODE with insane speed (50 px/frame)!
- NEW: Wall-pass works for BOTH following AND foraging - pets blink through walls to reach anything.
- NEW: Pets phase through **EVERYTHING** - water, walls, buildings, fences, rocks, trees, EVERYTHING!
- NEW: No collision checks in blink mode - pets become ghosts until they reach their target.
- NEW: Direction is LOCKED during wall-pass to prevent wobbling/flickering while phasing.
- NEW: Wall-pass INSTANTLY accelerates (0.8 lerp) - looks like a true teleport/blink.
- NEW: Wall-pass auto-exits when: reaching target, timeout (~4 sec max for long distances), or forage disappears.
- NEW: Increased timeout to 4 seconds (240 ticks) to handle long distances like crossing beaches.
- IMPROVED: Debug logging shows when blink activates, distance to target, and speed.
- IMPROVED: Forage wall-pass marks unreachable items after timeout and moves to next target.

=== Foraging Behavior Improvements ===
- CHANGED: Foraging takes ABSOLUTE priority - pet completely ignores player while collecting items.
- NEW: After picking up forage, pet IMMEDIATELY scans for the next forageable instead of returning to player!
- NEW: Pet only returns to player when ALL nearby forageables have been collected.
- NEW: Forage stuck activates WALL-PASS (0.5 sec) instead of marking unreachable immediately.
- NEW: Unreachable forage tiles tracked and cleared every 10 seconds.
- IMPROVED: Forage scanning every 12 ticks (was 15) for more responsive pickup.
- NEW: 10-tile leash - won't chase forageables too far from player while following.

=== Moonwalking Fix ===
- NEW: Direction is synced to velocity when transitioning between states.
- NEW: SyncDirectionToTarget() called when switching from forage to follow.
- NEW: SyncDirectionToVelocity() called after wall-pass completion.
- FIXED: Pet now faces the correct direction after picking up forageables.
- FIXED: Pet faces player immediately when forage target disappears.

=== Idle Roaming (NEW!) ===
- NEW: When player is stationary and pet is close, pet will do small random movements!
- NEW: Pet "roams" within 0.75 tiles of current position for natural behavior.
- NEW: Roaming only triggers after player stationary for 1+ second.
- NEW: 2% chance per tick to start a roam (not constant movement).
- NEW: Roaming cancels immediately when player moves or pet needs to follow.
- NEW: 30-tick cooldown between roams to prevent hyperactive behavior.

=== Movement System Overhaul ===
- NEW: State machine with 4 states: Idle, FollowingPlayer, Foraging, WallPassing.
- NEW: Smooth velocity-based movement with Vector2.Lerp acceleration (0.2 factor).
- NEW: Smooth deceleration when stopping (0.3 lerp toward zero instead of instant stop).
- NEW: Direction locking with configurable threshold (0.4) - prevents flickering on diagonal movement.
- NEW: Double direction lock time during wall-pass for extra stability.
- IMPROVED: Obstacle avoidance tries angles: 25°, -25°, 45°, -45°, 70°, -70° before sliding.
- IMPROVED: Slide movement at 60% speed along walls when angled approaches fail.
- IMPROVED: Follow distances: stop at 1.25 tiles, start at 2.5 tiles (tighter follow).
- IMPROVED: Speed scaling: 2.2x sprint (8+ tiles), 1.8x (6+ tiles), 1.4x (4+ tiles), 1.1x (2.5+ tiles).

=== Foraging System ===
- CHANGED: Foraging takes ABSOLUTE priority - pet completely ignores player while collecting items.
- NEW: Forage stuck activates WALL-PASS (0.5 sec) instead of marking unreachable immediately.
- NEW: Unreachable forage tiles tracked and cleared every 10 seconds.
- IMPROVED: Forage scanning every 12 ticks (was 15) for more responsive pickup.
- IMPROVED: Immediately scans for next forageable after pickup (no delay).
- NEW: 10-tile leash - won't chase forageables too far from player.

=== Harmony Patches ===
- NEW: RunState_Prefix - completely suppresses vanilla pet AI when following/working.
- NEW: BehaviorOnFarmerLocationEntry_Prefix - prevents random sleep behavior while following.
- IMPROVED: Forces pet out of Sleep/SitDown behaviors when follow activates.
- IMPROVED: Clears vanilla PathFindController to prevent conflicts.

=== Edge Cases Handled ===
- Location changes: Properly warps pet and resets all state.
- Water navigation: Even in wall-pass, pets route around water tiles.
- Forage stuck: After 0.5 sec, activates wall-pass to reach it (or marks unreachable after 2 sec timeout).
- Wall-pass stuck: Times out after 2 seconds, gives normal movement another chance.
- State transitions: Full state reset when toggling follow mode.
- Animation: Proper animate calls, smooth stop animation on halt.
- Direction sync: Facing direction always matches movement direction after state changes.

=== Other Fixes ===
- FIXED: Pet command menu no longer hijacks normal interaction (hold LeftShift to open).

=== Follow Mode - Now Fully Functional! ===
- MAJOR: Follow mode upgraded from experimental to fully functional!
- CHANGED: "Follow Outside Farm" is now enabled by default - pets will follow you everywhere!
- NEW: Pets now forage while following you! They automatically pick up forageable items (berries, mushrooms, spring onions, etc.) nearby and store them in their inventory.
- NEW: HUD notification appears whenever your pet picks up a forageable item showing what they found.
- NEW: "No work to do" notification when your pet can't find any debris, trees, or boulders to clear.
- IMPROVED: Stuck pet detection now uses ultra-fast speed to bypass obstacles instead of awkward teleporting.
- IMPROVED: Pets smoothly accelerate through walls when stuck, then slow back down once clear - no more jarring warps!
- IMPROVED: Message changed from "too far away" to "not on the same area" for clarity when pets are in different locations.
- Added "Forage While Following" config option (enabled by default) to toggle pet foraging behavior.
- Fast mode automatically deactivates when pet reaches player or makes good progress.

=== Whistle & Menu System ===
- Whistle keybind system! Press V (default, configurable) to open/close pet selection menu.
- NEW: Whistle Key is now configurable directly in Generic Mod Config Menu! No more editing config.json manually.
- Whistle menu features full-body pet sprites (like Animals page), scrolling for many pets, and clear status indicators.
- Menu shows pet name, current status (Idle/Working/Following), and disables pets already following or in different areas.
- Pet tracking arrows now display pet icons next to them (separated, larger scale, biased toward center).

=== Quality of Life ===
- Pets in follow mode are now passable - you can walk through them to get through doors easily.
- Pets automatically exit resting/sleeping state when you change locations while following.
- Trees at ALL growth stages (0-5) can now be removed by working pets, including seeds (stage 0).
- Small trees (stages 0-4) use appropriate twig effects instead of full tree chopping effects.

- Added proper destruction visuals/FX/SFX when pets clear debris/wood/stone (no more silent disappearing).
- Adjusted wood-related destruction to use a consistent twig-style particle/poof effect.
- Fixed cases where pets could get stuck while doing work by adding a warp fallback near the target.
- Improved follow behavior with catch-up speed scaling and a stuck warp fallback near the player.
