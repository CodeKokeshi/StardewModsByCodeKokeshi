1.4.0
- Exploration system with simple teleport and circular route patterns
- Pet follows a circular route (clockwise or counter-clockwise, randomly chosen each time)

- Forage pickup HUD messages respect ShowForageNotifications config
- State change messages respect ShowStateNotifications config
- Removed verbose debug logs for cleaner console output
- Pet command menu requires holding LeftShift to prevent hijacking normal interaction

1.3.1
