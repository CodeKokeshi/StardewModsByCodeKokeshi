1.4.0
- Exploration system with simple teleport and circular route patterns
- Pet follows a circular route (clockwise or counter-clockwise, randomly chosen each time)

- Counter-clockwise: BusStop → Town → Mountains → Railroad → Backwoods → Forest → Woods → Beach (loop)
- Pet teleports directly to areas with forageables (no complex pathing)
- Exploration pre-scans all areas and only visits areas that have items to collect
- When area is cleared, pet teleports to next area in the circular route
- Exploration ends when all areas are cleared OR inventory is full
- When done exploring, pet returns to farm and rests for the day
- Explore option hidden when already explored today, inventory full, or no forage available
- Pets can be whistled back during exploration (pauses exploration)
- "Continue exploring" option available when exploration was paused
- Only one pet can explore at a time (other pets show disabled option)
- Each area is marked as "cleared" when no forageables remain, resets daily
- Right-click pet to open command menu (dialogue only appears when stationary, not while walking)
- Notifications added for exploration start, work start, and work stop
- Each pet now has its own separate inventory (no longer shared between all pets)

- Pet sounds now correctly match pet type (dogs bark, cats meow, turtles chirp, etc.)
- Pet uses EXTREME BLINK wall-pass system to reach forageables through any obstacle
- Complete follow system rewrite eliminates stuttering and left-right flickering
- Pets no longer get stuck on obstacles with automatic EXTREME BLINK activation
- EXTREME BLINK activates after 0.5 seconds stuck with 50 px/frame speed
- Wall-pass works for both following and foraging, phases through everything
- Direction locked during wall-pass to prevent wobbling while phasing
- Wall-pass auto-exits when reaching target or 4 second timeout
- Vanilla pet behavior no longer interferes with mod-controlled movement
- Pets won't randomly fall asleep or sit down while following
- Fixed moonwalking bug where pet moved while facing opposite direction
- Pet immediately looks for next forageable after pickup instead of returning to player
- Foraging takes absolute priority over following when items are nearby
- After picking up forage, pet immediately scans for next item instead of returning to player
- Pet only returns to player when all nearby forageables are collected
- 10-tile forage leash prevents chasing items too far from player
- Unreachable forage tiles tracked and cleared every 10 seconds
- Forage scanning improved to every 12 ticks for more responsive pickup
- Idle roaming behavior when player is stationary and pet is close
- Pet does small random movements within 0.75 tiles for natural behavior

- State machine with 4 states: Idle, FollowingPlayer, Foraging, WallPassing
- Smooth velocity-based movement with Vector2.Lerp acceleration
- Smooth deceleration when stopping instead of instant halt
- Direction locking with configurable threshold prevents flickering on diagonal movement
- Follow distances: stop at 1.25 tiles, start at 2.5 tiles for tighter following

- "Show State Notifications" config option added (disabled by default)
- Forage pickup HUD messages respect ShowForageNotifications config
- State change messages respect ShowStateNotifications config
- Removed verbose debug logs for cleaner console output
- Pet command menu requires holding LeftShift to prevent hijacking normal interaction
- Overnight scavenging works regardless of current pet state
- Added i18n support for pet menu and HUD messages

1.3.1
- Fixed bug where SMAPI console window would flash repeatedly after naming a new pet during the adoption cutscene.
- Pets now use vanilla interaction behavior during events, cutscenes, and when menus/dialogues are active to prevent conflicts.

1.3.0
=== Follow Mode - Now Fully Functional! ===
- MAJOR: Follow mode upgraded from experimental to fully functional!
- CHANGED: "Follow Outside Farm" is now enabled by default - pets will follow you everywhere!
- NEW: Pets now forage while following you! They automatically pick up forageable items (berries, mushrooms, spring onions, etc.) nearby and store them in their inventory.
- NEW: HUD notification appears whenever your pet picks up a forageable item showing what they found.
- NEW: "No work to do" notification when your pet can't find any debris, trees, or boulders to clear.
- IMPROVED: Stuck pet detection now uses ultra-fast speed to bypass obstacles instead of awkward teleporting.
- IMPROVED: Pets smoothly accelerate through walls when stuck, then slow back down once clear - no more jarring warps!
- IMPROVED: Message changed from "too far away" to "not on the same area" for clarity when pets are in different locations.
- Added "Forage While Following" config option (enabled by default) to toggle pet foraging behavior.
- Fast mode automatically deactivates when pet reaches player or makes good progress.

=== Whistle & Menu System ===
- Whistle keybind system! Press V (default, configurable) to open/close pet selection menu.
- NEW: Whistle Key is now configurable directly in Generic Mod Config Menu! No more editing config.json manually.
- Whistle menu features full-body pet sprites (like Animals page), scrolling for many pets, and clear status indicators.
- Menu shows pet name, current status (Idle/Working/Following), and disables pets already following or in different areas.
- Pet tracking arrows now display pet icons next to them (separated, larger scale, biased toward center).

=== Quality of Life ===
- Pets in follow mode are now passable - you can walk through them to get through doors easily.
- Pets automatically exit resting/sleeping state when you change locations while following.
- Trees at ALL growth stages (0-5) can now be removed by working pets, including seeds (stage 0).
- Small trees (stages 0-4) use appropriate twig effects instead of full tree chopping effects.
- Fixed stuck loop counter not accumulating properly after warps.
- Removed "(Experimental)" label from Follow Outside Farm option - the feature is now stable!

1.2.0
- Multi-pet support! Each pet now works independently (Pet Licenses compatible).
- Target reservation system prevents pets from targeting the same debris.
- Collision avoidance keeps pets from stacking on each other.
- Pets now pause and stop moving when you talk to them.
- After 3 failed warp attempts, pets destroy target remotely (fixes infinite stuck loops).
- Trees at all growth stages (1-5) can now be removed, not just fully grown ones.

1.1.0
- Added proper destruction visuals/FX/SFX when pets clear debris/wood/stone (no more silent disappearing).
- Adjusted wood-related destruction to use a consistent twig-style particle/poof effect.
- Fixed cases where pets could get stuck while doing work by adding a warp fallback near the target.
- Improved follow behavior with catch-up speed scaling and a stuck warp fallback near the player.
