# Working Pets v1.3.0 - New Features

## What's New

### 🚀 Follow Mode - Now Fully Functional!
Follow mode has been upgraded from experimental to fully functional!

**Pet Foraging System:**
- When following you, pets automatically detect and pick up nearby forageable items
- Works with spring onions, berries, mushrooms, flowers, and other forage items
- Items are stored in the pet's inventory (check it by talking to them)
- HUD notification shows what your pet found each time they pick something up
- Configurable: Can be disabled in Generic Mod Config Menu

**Smart Obstacle Bypass:**
- No more awkward teleporting when pets get stuck!
- Pets now use ultra-fast speed to smoothly pass through obstacles
- They slow back down once they're clear and making progress
- Much more natural-looking movement than sudden warps

**Improved Messaging:**
- "Too far away" messages changed to "not on the same area" for clarity
- Better communication about why you can't whistle a pet (they're in a different location)

### 🎺 Visible Whistle Button
- Open Animals page (ESC → Animals tab)
- **New whistle button** appears at bottom-right corner
- Clear tooltip: "Click pets to whistle them (switches to follow mode)"
- Click any pet in the list to call them to you
- Only works if pet is in same location as you

### 🗺️ NPC Map Locations Integration
If you have **NPC Map Locations** mod installed:
- Your pets will appear on the map
- Shows their **custom names** (the names you gave them)
- Tracks them just like villagers
- Fully compatible with multi-pet setup

### ✅ Fixed and Improved
- Removed buggy floating icons above pets
- Kept only off-screen arrow indicators
- Arrows at screen edges show pet icons
- Green arrows = pet is working

## How to Use

### Foraging While Following:
1. Talk to your pet and select "Follow me"
2. Walk around any location with forageable items
3. Your pet will automatically approach and collect nearby items
4. Check their inventory periodically to claim your loot!

### Calling Your Pet:
1. Press ESC → Animals tab
2. Look for the whistle button (bottom-right, has a horn icon)
3. Click on any pet in the list
4. Pet switches to follow mode and comes to you
5. Only works if pet is in your current location

### Tracking Pets:
- **Off-screen**: Arrows with pet icons show at screen edges
- **With NPC Map Locations**: Pets appear on the map with their names

## Configuration Options

New in 1.3.0:
- **Forage While Following**: Enable/disable automatic forage collection (default: enabled)
- **Follow Outside Farm**: Allow pets to follow in non-farm areas (default: disabled)

## Known Limitations
- Whistle only works in same location (can't call across maps)

- Foraging only works while in follow mode
