1.3.0
- Whistle keybind system! Press V (default) to open a menu and select which pet to call.
- Menu shows all pets with their names - enabled if same location, disabled if too far.
- Pet tracking arrows now show pet icons next to them (separated with space, larger, biased toward player).
- Trees at ALL growth stages (0-5) can now be removed, including seeds (stage 0).
- Small trees (stages 0-4) use appropriate twig effects instead of full tree effects.
- Fixed stuck loop counter not accumulating properly after warps.
- Whistle key can be configured in config.json (default: V key).

1.2.0
- Multi-pet support! Each pet now works independently (Pet Licenses compatible).
- Target reservation system prevents pets from targeting the same debris.
- Collision avoidance keeps pets from stacking on each other.
- Pets now pause and stop moving when you talk to them.
- After 3 failed warp attempts, pets destroy target remotely (fixes infinite stuck loops).
- Trees at all growth stages (1-5) can now be removed, not just fully grown ones.

1.1.0
- Added proper destruction visuals/FX/SFX when pets clear debris/wood/stone (no more silent disappearing).
- Adjusted wood-related destruction to use a consistent twig-style particle/poof effect.
- Fixed cases where pets could get stuck while doing work by adding a warp fallback near the target.
- Improved follow behavior with catch-up speed scaling and a stuck warp fallback near the player.
