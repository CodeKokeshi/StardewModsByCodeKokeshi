- NPC Map Locations integration! Pets now appear on the map mod with their custom names.
- Small trees (stages 1-4) now use appropriate twig effects instead of full tree effects.
- Fixed stuck loop counter not accumulating properly after warps.
- Removed buggy floating icons above pets (kept only off-screen indicators).

1.2.0
- Multi-pet support! Each pet now works independently (Pet Licenses compatible).
- Target reservation system prevents pets from targeting the same debris.
- Collision avoidance keeps pets from stacking on each other.
- Pets now pause and stop moving when you talk to them.

1.1.0
- Added proper destruction visuals/FX/SFX when pets clear debris/wood/stone (no more silent disappearing).
- Adjusted wood-related destruction to use a consistent twig-style particle/poof effect.
- Fixed cases where pets could get stuck while doing work by adding a warp fallback near the target.
- Improved follow behavior with catch-up speed scaling and a stuck warp fallback near the player.
