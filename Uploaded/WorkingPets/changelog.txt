1.3.0
- Whistle keybind system! Press V (default, configurable in config.json) to open/close a pet selection menu.
- Whistle menu features full-body pet sprites (like Animals page), scrolling for many pets, and clear status indicators.
- Menu shows pet name, current status (Idle/Working/Following), and disables pets already following or too far away.
- Pet tracking arrows now display pet icons next to them (separated, larger scale, biased toward center).
- Pets in follow mode are now passable - you can walk through them to get through doors easily.
- Pets automatically exit resting/sleeping state when you change locations while following.
- Trees at ALL growth stages (0-5) can now be removed by working pets, including seeds (stage 0).
- Small trees (stages 0-4) use appropriate twig effects instead of full tree chopping effects.
- Fixed stuck loop counter not accumulating properly after warps.

1.2.0
- Multi-pet support! Each pet now works independently (Pet Licenses compatible).
- Target reservation system prevents pets from targeting the same debris.
- Collision avoidance keeps pets from stacking on each other.
- Pets now pause and stop moving when you talk to them.
- After 3 failed warp attempts, pets destroy target remotely (fixes infinite stuck loops).
- Trees at all growth stages (1-5) can now be removed, not just fully grown ones.

1.1.0
- Added proper destruction visuals/FX/SFX when pets clear debris/wood/stone (no more silent disappearing).
- Adjusted wood-related destruction to use a consistent twig-style particle/poof effect.
- Fixed cases where pets could get stuck while doing work by adding a warp fallback near the target.
- Improved follow behavior with catch-up speed scaling and a stuck warp fallback near the player.
