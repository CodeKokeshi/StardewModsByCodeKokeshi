# Working Pets v1.3.0 - New Features

## What's Fixed and Changed

### ✅ Removed Buggy Floating Icons
- No more pet icons floating above pets on screen (looked like a bug)
- Kept only the off-screen arrow indicators

### 🎯 Improved Off-Screen Tracking
- Arrows at screen edges now show **pet icons** next to them
- You can see WHICH pet the arrow is pointing to
- Green arrows = pet is working

### 🎺 Visible Whistle Button
- Open Animals page (ESC → Animals tab)
- **New whistle button** appears at bottom-right corner
- Clear tooltip: "Click pets to whistle them (switches to follow mode)"
- Click any pet in the list to call them to you
- Only works if pet is in same location as you

### 🗺️ NPC Map Locations Integration
If you have **NPC Map Locations** mod installed:
- Your pets will appear on the map
- Shows their **custom names** (the names you gave them)
- Tracks them just like villagers
- Fully compatible with multi-pet setup

## How to Use

### Calling Your Pet:
1. Press ESC → Animals tab
2. Look for the whistle button (bottom-right, has a horn icon)
3. Click on any pet in the list
4. Pet switches to follow mode and comes to you
5. Only works if pet is in your current location

### Tracking Pets:
- **Off-screen**: Arrows with pet icons show at screen edges
- **With NPC Map Locations**: Pets appear on the map with their names

## Known Limitations
- Whistle only works in same location (can't teleport across maps)
- NPC Map Locations integration is automatic (no configuration needed)
